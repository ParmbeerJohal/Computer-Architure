# Computer-Architure

## Overview
This course introduces the basic building blocks as well as advanced architectural structures used in modern computer systems with emphasis on techniques for speed and performance enhancement. Hardware design aspects and the interface between hardware and software are considered. Assembly language programming will be used as an illustration of certain concepts.

Students will have the opportunity to pursue topics in computer architecture related to their particular interest through completing larger written projects.

## Topics:
- instruction sets and processor architecture
- pipelining
- memory hierarchy design
- instruction-level parallelism
- data-level parallelism
- thread-level parallelism
- representative architectures especially RISC architecture
- multiprocessors and parallel machines
- GPUs
- DSAs
