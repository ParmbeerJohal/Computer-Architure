The proposal looks doable, although I will ask the group to also
concentrate one one more aspect. That is, these supercomputers usually
are designed with particular kinds of algorithms in mind, and
parallelizing these can be a challenge. The report should also include
some description and analysis of how the system architects deal with
the amount of data and sheer scale of parallel instruction flows in a
way that yields usable results..
